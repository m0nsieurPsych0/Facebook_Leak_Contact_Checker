# Story

After the leak of over 500 millions Facebook user data, I wanted to find out if any of my friends have been affected. Since I have a lot of contacts, I did not want to use a site like [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) because I would have had to check each one individually. So to help me it so I wrote this program.

# Goal
The goal of this program is to batch check if any of your contact have been affected.  

To do the check we use a vcard file that all phone uses to store contacts then we check agains one file of the leak.

---

# Usage

All you have to do is export a vcard **('.vcf')** from your phone, provide a file from the leak and let the program do the rest.  

**_you may find the files from the leak on your favorite torrent providers\*\*_**

### 1- install dependency for parsing vcards

      pip install vobject

### 2- use the program

      python main.py -i 'contact.vcf' -l 'Country.txt'
